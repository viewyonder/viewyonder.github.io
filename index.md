## Finding what you need

At the moment, I use jekyll-search which basically let's you find things in the index. At some point, I'll add a Google Customer Search.

{% include note.html content="If you don't find what you need, why not <a alt='let us know' href='mailto:letusknow@viewyonder.com'>let us know</a> so we can look at filling a gap. This is a community site not a commercial one. You are welcome and encouraged to contribute. You can clone, add pages and do pull requests -- or you can just <a alt='submit content' href='mailto:submissions@viewyonder.com'>submit a link or copy</a>. We would also love <a alt='provide feedback' href='feedback@viewyonder.com'>feedback</a>." %}
