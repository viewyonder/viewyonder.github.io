summary: Hello, good evening, and welcome. I'm Steve Chambers -- aka as <a alt='ukcloud pro on twitter' href='https://twitter.com/ukcloudpro'>ukcloudpro</a>. This is my ever-growing collection of curated cloud content focused specifically on AWS. I'm forever learning, doing and sharing so I thought I might as well get it all organized and share it properly! I hope this is useful for you, <a alt='feedback email' href='mailto:feedback@viewyonder.com'>let me know</a> what you think?

## Finding what you need

At the moment, I use jekyll-search (see top right navbar) but I will add a Google Custom Search Engine at some point.

{% include note.html content="If you don't find what you need, why not <a alt='let me know' href='mailto:feedback@viewyonder.com'>let me know</a> so I can look at filling a gap. I'm always on the look-out for useful stuff that helps me and others. I think the AWS community is a very open and sharing community, and I hope this site helps. You can add content directly by cloning, add pages and do pull requests -- or you can just <a alt='submit content' href='mailto:submissions@viewyonder.com'>submit a link or copy</a> and tell me what's great about what you've found. I'd love any  constuctive and helpful <a alt='provide feedback' href='feedback@viewyonder.com'>feedback</a>." %}

{% include links.html %}
